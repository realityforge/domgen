* Imit: Generate events for subscriptions starting and completing on the client side.
* JWS: Add ability to document wsdl
* Generate documentation indicating the template groups, contained artifacts, facet list, facet configurations
  etc from metadata attached to code.
* When we define the artifacts in the model files, we should also be able to define the "template_group" and
  "artifact type" (ie, main/java vs test/java vs main/resources etc). This would allow us to remove the need
  for generator.rb files.
* Make it possible to define a model check that defines the dependency requirements
  between schemas. i.e. Entity can not be referenced by anyone. Template can reference
  Entity but not Overtimes etc.
* Support constants in relationship_constraints
* Fix xmi generation: fix existing enumeration/service generation, add message generation
* Introduce the "uses" metadata for service that can refer to entities (a.k.a DAOs) and other services. Use this to
  generate abstract service with required dependencies and update the uml generated.
* Add xor constraint
* Add state machine (based on rails gem or erlang library?)
* Add validation annotations; @NotNull, @Pattern, @Past
* Add unique constraints in jpa ala

* Use javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSeeAlso in inheritance hierarchies ala Exception/Entity
* In the imit facet, the server side code for collecting objects in a graph can generate lot's of
  instances. Every flush requires every one of those instances be dirty-checked. Every database
  operation results in a flush atm. This results in very very very very very slow loads. Of particular
  concern is loads such as planners MetaData graph that takes an extremely long time. In planner we
  we cache the output so the problem is mitigated, but in Acal/Calendar there is no caching and this
  problem is amplified when scaling up.
* Generate an error when you disable a facet (i.e. json) but it is referenced by a different element
  with a facet that requires the presence of the disabled facet (i.e. the gwt_rpc facet requires the
  json facet if a struct is referenced from a gwt_rpc enabled method)
* Add a disable_all_but(facet_array for facets that will respect dependencies and will not disable
  required facets for the facets passed in the parameter.
