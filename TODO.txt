* Make it possible to define a model check that defines the dependency requirements
  between schemas. i.e. Entity can not be referenced by anyone. Template can reference
  Entity but not Overtimes etc.
* Support constants in relationship_constraints
* Remove imit.client_side? and replace with imit?
* Fix xmi generation: fix existing enumeration/service generation, add message generation
* Introduce the "uses" metadata for service that can refer to entities (a.k.a DAOs) and other services. Use this to
  generate abstract service with required dependencies and update the uml generated.
* Start to generate entity=>struct mappers based on rules or explicit mappings
* Disabling a facet should disable facet on all child elements, likewise for enabling the facet
* Add xor constraint
* Add state machine (based on rails gem or erlang library?)
* Use javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSeeAlso in inheritance hierarchies ala Exception/Entity
* For both JPA and JWS we want to use vendor specific extensions. In JPA you want to define the Indexes and other
  database artifacts while in JWS you want to indicate that a service should be validated for compliance with SOAP
  xsd and also you want to use vendor specific extensions to annotate methods/services with wsdl documentation. Domgen
  should be extended to support one vendor per facet, per repository. Then it would default to adding the annotations
  for that particular vendor.
